In order to find the equation of the function in the table, we can use the point-slope form, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1). We can choose any two points from the table to plug into the point-slope form. For example, we could choose the points (16, 0) and (17, 6). Plugging these values into the point-slope form, we get 0 - 6 = m(16 - 17), which simplifies to m = -6. Therefore, the equation of the function is y = -6x + 6. Since the equation is in the form y = mx + b, the function is linear. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",

The equation of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In order to find the equation of the function in the table, we can use the point-slope form, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1). We can choose any two points from the table to plug into the equation. For example, we could choose the points (16, 0) and (17, 6). Plugging these values into the equation, we get 0 - 0 = m(16 - 17), which simplifies to m = 6. Therefore, the equation of the function is y = 6x. Since the equation is linear, the function is linear.",

In order to find the equation of the function in the table, we can use the point-slope form, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1). Plugging in the coordinates of one of the points in the table, we get y - 10 = m(x - 14), which simplifies to y = mx - m(14) + 10. We can then plug in the coordinates of another point to solve for m. For example, if we plug in the coordinates of the point (15, 15), we get 15 = m(15) - m(14) + 10, which simplifies to 15 = 15m - m + 10. Solving for m, we get m = 1.

In order to find the equation of the function in the table, we can use the point-slope form, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1). We can choose any point from the table, so let's choose (8, 6). Plugging in the values, we get y - 6 = m(x - 8). Now we can solve for m. We know that m = (y - y1)/(x - x1), so m = (6 - 6)/(8 - 8) = 0.
